                        <li>Collaborated with a large multidisciplinary team of GIMM students and Boise State History
                            Department faculty to recreate a historically accurate 3D model of the original train
                            station as it appeared 100 years ago.</li>

                        <li>Modeled architectural structures, props, and environmental details based on archival
                            photographs, blueprints, and historical documentation.</li>

                        <li>Created time-period accurate character models and ambient scene elements to portray daily
                            life and activity around the station.</li>

                        <li>Developed an animated train arrival sequence to enhance environmental storytelling and
                            historical immersion.</li>

                        <li>Helped integrate the 3D environment into an interactive website where users can explore the

                            sound design, particle effects, and UI implementation.</li>

                        <li>Created a variety of custom puzzle mechanics such as keycard systems, power rerouting
                            challenges, environmental triggers, and interactive consoles, each integrated through
                            object-oriented C# scripts.</li>

                        <li>Modeled modular sci-fi corridors, props, terminals, lighting fixtures, and environmental

                        <li>Built a clean, accessibility-focused interface with large interactive elements, readable
                            layouts, and intuitive interaction flow informed by user personas and accessibility design
                            principles.</li>

                        <li>Implemented ARKit functionality to create an augmented reality checkout-training simulation,
                            allowing users to practice the step-by-step process of purchasing items at the GIMM front
                            desk.</li>

                        <li>Learned and implemented session-persistent AR anchors to ensure virtual objects stayed fixed
